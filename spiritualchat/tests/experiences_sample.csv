South Indian Haunted House,"There is this house present in a city named Bengaluru which is in the South side of India, a person saw shadows lurking inside the house from the windows in the period of dusk, he got scared and was frozen to death he said, the testimony was not recorded as the person said he saw some shadows lurking around the house and suddenly when he was looking all of it all stopped and the window banged with a thud twice he described and when he tried to move, he could not, he felt as if something was fixed to the ground with his legs and body went all numb for 30-40 seconds,  while he was describing he was shivering, there after he got fever and now is hospitalized,, When I further inquired i got to know that the old couple living there died around 3 years ago but yet they have some unfulfilled wishes related to their son who actually tried to push their own parents near death, no one yet knows how both of them died, it is still a mystery, due to which their spirits are still on ground. May god give them heaven, that is what I can pray for!",https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1IApA5q3Jaz4rDMrj_LC37iUGOijLBt3H,,,Poltergeist (Ghost),"Scared to death, felt spiritual presence, frozen, overwhelmed","felt presence of divine power, negative energy, no pain, out of ordinary, saw other spirits","Change in previous believes, Fever, Hospital, increased awareness","January 19, 2023 12:00 AM",29 Years Old,"January 19, 2023 12:00 AM",https://www.notion.so/Abandoned-House-of-an-Old-Couple-55c24707a7e84f9d846a9f079b3ac73a,,5-6 minutes,1056,Male,Well Researched,,,Suraj Singh
